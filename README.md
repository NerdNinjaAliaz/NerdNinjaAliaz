### 📌 About Me

I am a Biomedical Engineer passionaye for **building AI systems that save lives**. My work bridges clinical medicine and cutting-edge machine learning — from segmenting cancer cells under a microscope to deploying LLMs for medical text analysis.

I specialize in **Deep Learning**, **Medical Image Processing**, and **Multimodal AI**, with hands-on experience in **CNNs, Transformers, RNNs, YOLO, UNet**, and now **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I’ve built models for tumor detection, cell classification, Bitcoin forecasting, and even automated CAPTCHA solving — always with an eye toward real-world impact.

Currently exploring how **LLMs can assist in clinical documentation, radiology report generation, and patient triage** — because healthcare deserves intelligent automation.
